node with script.

standart Ysort godot node sorts view of objects (whitch behind and whitch in front) on 2D scene by their Y position that is useful, but!
...but sometimes we need to keep track of which node are closer to look, this one solves that.
it sorts Ysort nodes children in tree by ther Ypos, so the closest/farest one will always be the first child of the Ysort node.

important: it sorts ONLY nodes that inherits from (or are) <Node2D>!

note: script are embeded in saved scene (but copy of it are here as well)
