standart godot's camera2D node with screen drag feature.

editor:
[dragFunctionEnabled] switch to enable/disable drag function
[dragSpeed] speed of camera follow drag (if set more than 1 - I strongly recomend to set camera smoothing!)

signals:
[screenDragStarted(Vector2 position)] emits on start of drag action, returns start position of it
[screenDragEnded(Vector2 position)] emits on dragging end, returns end drag position
[dragFuncEnabled] emits when dragging enabled
[dragFuncDisabled] emits when dragging disabled

note: its for tochscreen by default. To use it with mouse simply turn on "emulate touch from mouse" in project settings > input devices > pointing.
